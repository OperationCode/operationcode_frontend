## What is a frontend?
When you visit our website you're interacting with two systems, a frontend application and a backend application. The frontend application (where you are now) is responsible for displaying images, text and data on our web pages.
Frontend applications are usually written using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and utilize one or more frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Vue, and React. https://operationcode.org uses React.

## What is a backend?
The backend is responsible for providing data to the front end to display, and processing data entered into the frontend, and running various jobs like inviting new users to Slack, or signing them up for our newsletter. The https://operationcode.org backend is written in Rails and can be viewed at https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend.

## Mocking Backend Server API

We are using [Apiary.io](http://docs.operationcodeapi.apiary.io) for our Backend documentation. It also includes a Mocking Server so you don't have to stand up the whole backend. You just need to hit the Mock API endpoints for whatever it is you're testing.

To use, navigate to [Apiary.io](http://docs.operationcodeapi.apiary.io).

For example, you want to gather all CodeSchool Members. Click on `CodeSchool | Collection` on the left-hand side. Select `List All CodeSchool Members`.

A form will populate. You can switch to an Example Code in the langauge of your choosing. More than likely it will be JavaScript on the front-end.

In the dropdown menu, select `Mock Server` and click on `Try`.

You will see a `GET` request with the mock endpoint url. You can now copy and paste that into your front-end to test your code.

Don't forget to remove the mock endpoint url when committing your changes for production. Reset your values and select `Production` to get the correct endpoint url.
