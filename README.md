## What is a frontend?
When you visit our website you're intereacting with two systems, a frontend application and a backend application.
The frontend application (where you are now) is responsible for displaying images, text and data on our web pages.
Frontend applications are usually written using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and utilize 1 or more
frameworks such as Angular, backbone, vue, and react. https://operationcode.org uses react.

## What is a backend?
The backend is responsible for providing data to the front end to display, and processing data entered into the
frontend, and running various jobs like inviting new users to slack, or signing them up for our newsletter. The
https://operationcode.org backend is written in rails and can be viewed at
https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend.
