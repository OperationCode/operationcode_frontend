            Code schools are accelerated learning programs that will prepare you for a career in
            software development. <br />Each school listed below ranges in length, vary in tuition costs,
            and in programming languages. <br />Desirable from an employer&apos;s standpoint, code schools
            are founded by software developers who saw a need <br />for more programmers and aspired to
            teach the next generation.
            <br />
            <br />
            We encourage you to check out the schools below, do your research, and ask fellow
            software developers in Slack or our <a href="https://community.operationcode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forums</a>.
