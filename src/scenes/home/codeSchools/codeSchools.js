            Code schools are accelerated learning programs that will prepare you for a career in
            software development. <br />Each school listed below ranges in length, vary in tuition
            costs, and in programming languages. <br />Desirable from an employer&apos;s standpoint,
            code schools are founded by software developers who saw a need <br />for more
            programmers and aspired to teach the next generation.
            <br />
            <br />
            We encourage you to check out the schools below, do your research, and ask fellow
            techies in our Slack Community.
