        <p>The Operation Code Board of Directors, all-volunteer staff, and more than 3,211 members cordially invite you to the Deploy the Future Gala November 10, 2017 in the Governor Ballroom at Portland’s historic Sentinel Hotel.</p>
        <p>At Operation Code, we have grown leaps and bounds since committing the first line of code in 2014. It was not that long ago computer coding schools were not accepting the New GI Bill to pay for tuition, room and board. Today, there are ten coding boot camps nationwide accepting U.S. Veterans and the New GI Bill. Lives have been transformed: from veterans attending code schools and building careers in the tech industry to those just being introduced to computer coding.</p>
        <p>Through this short and successful journey, we have come to learn that our challenge is significantly larger than we originally understood. The impact we have on these veterans and their families is much broader than we originally envisioned. Today, we are more motivated than ever to expand the bandwidth of Operation Code to provide this continuously growing community of veterans with a skill set that will allow them to become self-sustaining and contribute generously to our society.</p>
        <p>The Operation Code community gratefully offers you the opportunity to join us in this mission! Operation Code and the Deploy the Future Gala are vehicles for us to each grow our impact. We hope you will join our efforts to ease the transition of our veterans back to civilian life, and contribute to an endowment to provide scholarships to the men and women who have given so much to all of us.</p>
        <p>In becoming a Deploy the Future sponsor, you will have a front row seat to supporting a great cause and promoting your organization to civic and military officials; business, tech and community leaders; and our global community of military veterans who are bettering themselves with educational opportunities through Operation Code.</p>
        <p>Please join this incredibly dedicated team of individuals known as Operation Code as we expand our services, educate our veterans, and Deploy the Future.</p>
