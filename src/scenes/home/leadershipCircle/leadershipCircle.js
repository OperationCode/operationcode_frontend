      <p>Operation Code is pleased to invite you to join the Leadership Circle.</p>
      <p>
        The Leadership Circle exists for people who passionately believe in the Operation Code
        mission, have a vital interest in our success, recognize the importance of annual giving,
        and are fortunate enough to possess the ability to contribute significantly to Operation
        Code’s drive for impact, growth and sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Leadership Circle members, we are passionate advocates for the mission. Our volunteerism
        helps the community, whether by bringing in new supporters or by mentoring a transitioning
        veteran or military spouse. Our compelling events allow us to connect with leaders in tech,
        among veterans and active duty military alike, and to bring new people join in Operation
        Code’s work. And our financial contributions secure Operation Code’s ability to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please join us and help make our mission a success. Together, we will create a new and
        secure future for today’s veterans and military spouses.
